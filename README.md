# Plant-Disease-Predition-using-Multimodal-AI

The Plant disease prediction is inherently a multimodal challenge, influenced by various interacting factors such as weather conditions, soil health, plant physiological states and pest interactions combining diverse data modalities has the potential to provide a more accurate, comprehensive and reliable prediction system.

Innovative  Multimodal  AI  Based  Regression  algorithm  to  predict  plant  diseases  by combining data from different sources. The integrates AI Models CNN for analyzing plant images and detecting early signs of disease, SVR for modeling the relationships between environmental and soil parameters and RFR for ensemble learning. 

The multimodal system is designed to handle diverse types of data, including sensor data, satellite imagery  and historical disease records making it adaptable to a wide range of agricultural settings and plant species demonstrating its superior predictive power compared to traditional Single Model Approaches.

Proposed System:

The aims to leverage BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for NLP tasks,  Word2Vec for Word Embeddings and Inception v3 for image analysis to create a comprehensive multimodal  approach for plant disease prediction.

BERT is a transformer based model that excels at understanding the context of words within sentences. Textual  data such as weather conditions, humidity and temperature gathered from sensors or reports. The Accuracy of  the model is high, comparison based method. Over all Performance of the System is High.

Word2Vec is a technique used to represent words as dense vectors, where words with similar meanings are  located close to each other in vector space.
